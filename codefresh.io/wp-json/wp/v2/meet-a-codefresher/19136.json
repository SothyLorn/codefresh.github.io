It\u2019s actually where I met my husband! He was the mechanic in the back, and I worked the front desk.<\/p>\n<p><b>How did you get into your current job or field?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Bear with me, it was an adventure. I worked for BCO, a mail-order cycling company. I was doing their e-commerce side when Facebook advertising was taking off. I was involved in growing those programs and doing affiliate marketing, which was my first taste of marketing. I also took an internship at this time at a software company for market research. As I grew their lead database, they asked if I wanted to become an SDR. I was then exposed to how leads came in, how they MQLed. I then got hired for demand gen! From there, I got into marketing operations at that same company.<\/p>\n<p><b>What&#8217;s a fun fact about you that not many people know?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I am really into genealogy. It started when we found out my dad discovered he was adopted, and we had very little to go on. We did months of research and eventually found my dad&#8217;s biological mom. A few years later, 23andMe came out. Last year, we had a hit with his half-sister, and she confirmed my dad&#8217;s biological dad&#8217;s identity.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is your favorite activity or hobby that you enjoy outside of work?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play a lot of ESO, Skyrim, and Minecraft. I also love reading. I have already read 60 books this year!<\/p>\n<p><b>What is your best memory or favorite thing about working at Codefresh?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We get together on Fridays for a happy hour via zoom. With people working remotely, I still feel like I know them, even though we\u2019ve never met! It\u2019s really easy to get lost and become a number when it\u2019s not personal. I really enjoy how Codefresh makes us feel like we are all people.<\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"19136\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Codefresh feels like real people.
