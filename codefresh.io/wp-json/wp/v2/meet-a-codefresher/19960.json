It was my first experience in a customer service role and I believe that everyone should have at least a year of experience in these types of roles. I learned so much about people through that job!<\/p>\n<p><b>How did you get into your current job or field?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>My parents were both programmers, so naturally I did NOT want to go into that field! They pushed me to take a programming course and the first day, I simply fell in love! I got my degree in Computer Science, and started working as a developer for a while. I felt like I was developing all these features without actually knowing how the product was being used and without a connection to the users. There was a developer who sat on the support team and I decided that\u2019s what I wanted to do! The mix of development and customer support naturally led me to supporting other programmers in the CI\/CD space and eventually into my current position.<\/p>\n<p><b>What&#8217;s a fun fact about you that not many people know?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I play Ice hockey in a women&#8217;s league. My husband taught me how to skate and when I learned how to stop and not bump into anyone, I started playing hockey!<\/p>\n<p>I also recently bought my childhood home and we have a mini farm on it. We live on 1 acre and we have ducks, chickens, rabbits, and dogs as well as a little orchard and gardens. My family also owns a real farm that my brother runs and we have a tiny house out there so we can stay closer to family on the weekends.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is your favorite activity or hobby that you enjoy outside of work?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I like to say that my hobby is collecting hobbies. I love to learn. From woodworking, to wedding makeup, to rock climbing &#8211; I like trying anything new.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is your best memory about working at Codefresh?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The thing that I love most about Codefresh is that even though we have been remote from the day I started, I still feel like a part of the team and the company! There is such an emphasis on people and connecting to one another, even on a global level. I love the culture, the empathy between colleagues, and the events and happy hours!<\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"19960\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is such an emphasis on people and connecting to one another, even on a global level.
