It\u2019s also a handy way to make sure that people who use your app are getting all the Node.js dependencies that the app requires to run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But getting software to your users is only half the battle. You also need to make sure your software is secure. You don\u2019t want to lose users because they discover security vulnerabilities in the Node.js pipeline that you use to deliver your app.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">npm and security challenges<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve followed Node.js news recently, you\u2019ll know that npm dependencies and security is a touchy subject. That\u2019s due especially to the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2016\/03\/23\/npm_left_pad_chaos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiasco<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> earlier in the spring involving the removal of a certain dependency from npm, which broke a large number of very popular packages that depended on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That episode didn\u2019t involve malicious hackers, just a frustrated developer who decided to remove his code from npm. But the impact on users was similar to what you\u2019d expect following a major DDoS attack. Lots of apps that people used every day stopped working.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The episode highlighted how vulnerable npm makes developers who rely on third-party dependencies and hope that the people maintaining those dependencies are, well, dependable. This isn\u2019t a security flaw in npm <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">per se<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it\u2019s a fundamental security challenge associated with the design of npm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m not trying to knock npm, by the way. The issue described above is an inevitable result of the flexible, community-oriented nature of npm itself. When you empower developers to collaborate on a massive scale in the way the Node.js community does, you also raise the risk that a few bad kinks within the community fabric could have negative repercussions for lots of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I should also note that npm fixed the issue involving the missing dependency remarkably quickly, and has taken steps to prevent the recurrence of an event like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Snyk to secure your pipeline<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, the problem remains that the npm dependency architecture can expose your users to security problems, even if your app itself is secure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, there\u2019s a solution in the form of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/snyk.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (not to be confused with the obscure Node module <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nodejsmodules.org\/pkg\/synk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">synk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, by the way), which lets you identify and fix security vulnerabilities in your Node pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snyk is pretty simple and flexible to use. It can scan for vulnerabilities by parsing either GitHub repositories or individual packages, and it provides its own CLI environment for finding vulnerabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that\u2019s not all. You can also use Snyk to fix vulnerabilities right from the CLI. When it finds a problem in any dependency within your pipeline, it will either give you an option to fix it automatically with a patch, or tell you that there is no known fix yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, Snyk doesn\u2019t work magic. It only finds and fixes known vulnerabilities. It doesn\u2019t try to discover previously undocumented flaws within your code itself. But no real repository security scanner goes that far.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the only real shortcoming in Snyk is that its name is hard to remember how to spell correctly. (But I\u2019m nitpicking here.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fitting Snyk into your Codefresh pipeline<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re developing a Node.js app, now you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=snyk&amp;utm_source=wordpress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Codefresh<\/a> to embed Snyk as part of your automated pipeline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codefresh enables you to easily customize your build, test deploy pipeline with a YAML file. You could <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/163211668\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">configure your pipeline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to execute a series of steps (clone git repo, build a Docker Image, perform unit &amp; integration test, and deploy image to production) on every commit, and run each step as a stand alone image or as part of a composition. To check your code for vulnerabilities, you can add a custom step in the Codefresh\u00a0YAML file.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.codefresh.io\/v1.0\/docs\/use-snyk-cli-for-your-nodejs-project?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=Synk&amp;utm_source=wordpress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codefresh YAML and Snyk CLI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can create the freestyle step in codefresh.yml to see which vulnerabilities in your dependencies should be fixed in your Nodejs pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example Snyk freestyle step:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\">snyk-test:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0image: node:latest\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0working-directory: ${{initial-clone}}\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fail-fast: false\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0commands:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- npm install\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- npm install -g snyk\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- snyk auth $SNYK_TOKEN\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- snyk test\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0environment:\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- SNYK_TOKEN=${{AUTH_TOKEN}}<\/pre>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply login to your Snyk account, under My account you\u2019ll find Your API token in the General tab.
