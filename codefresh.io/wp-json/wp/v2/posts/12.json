The funny thing is, so did Joyent CTO, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bcantrill\">Bryan Cantrill<\/a>. He very graciously tweeted my slide deck to his 5,400+ followers <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bcantrill\/status\/565295636791435267\">here<\/a>. It was all very flattering, considering that Bryan is a seriously great presenter.<\/p>\n<p>We ended up doing an ad hoc discussion panel in which he asked, why does the term &#8220;microservice&#8221; seem to rub some people the wrong way?<\/p>\n<p>I can understand the natural inclination to object to introducing new &#8220;buzzwords&#8221; for old ideas. The objection is basically that there is already a term for describing a system design pattern in which components provide services to other components over some type of communication protocol: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Service-oriented_architecture\">service-oriented architecture (SOA)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a fairly generic and abstract definition, so one could say that microservice architecture <em>is<\/em> SOA, but in fact it&#8217;s a bit more nuanced than that.<\/p>\n<p>For more than a decade, the term SOA has come to have a strong association with web services, SOAP, WSDL, WS-* standards, and everything else that implies, including generated SOAP stubs and proxies, application servers, service buses, and cumbersome deployment environments. This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/doc\/391595\/serviceoriented-architecture-scenario\">Gartner Report<\/a>\u00a0noted the mutually influential relationship of SOA and web services back in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, using SOAP-based web services is just one way to build service-oriented architecture. You can implement SOA with REST services as well, but the shared history of SOA and SOAP-based web services since the last decade has practically tethered the two in the mental model that comes to mind.<\/p>\n<p>Before the ascendancy of REST APIs, SOAP-based implementations dominated SOA discussion (<a href=\"https:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/aa480021.aspx\">see this 2004 Microsoft Journal article for example<\/a>). Unfortunately, this long association is hard to ignore.<\/p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.oasis-open.org\/soa-rm\/soa-ra\/v1.0\/soa-ra.html\">Oasis Reference Architecture Foundation for Service Oriented Architecture Version<\/a>\u00a0doesn&#8217;t specifically mention SOAP-based web services, it certainly does nothing to help dispel the notion of cumbersome complexity associated with SOA.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a good reason why REST APIs have become so prevalent. REST is the foundation of modern web architecture at Internet scale \u2014 and REST services are so easy to reason about.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adrianco\/status\/542850261782237184\">Fine grain SOA<\/a>&#8220;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u2014 Adrian Cockroft, former Netflix architect<\/p>\n<p>So far I&#8217;ve avoided actually trying to define a microservice. Like service-oriented architecture, you would be hard pressed to find a strict, canonical definition everyone agrees on. There&#8217;s no official standards body definition to refer to. Fowler and Lewis of ThoughtWorks <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/microservices.html\">published an article<\/a>\u00a0describing common characteristics of microservice architectural style in March 2014, but the term has continued to evolve and be refined since then.<\/p>\n<p>Terms enter into a professional vocabulary at some point when it becomes easier to use them for efficiency than to explain what you mean. Fowler defends his trait of introducing neologisms <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/bliki\/Neologism.html\">here<\/a>, quoting from The Gang of Four to rationalize that domain-specific jargon allows us to communicate at a higher level of abstraction.<\/p>\n<p>When &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; entered into the vocabulary, there were those who dismissed it as new buzzword for an old idea. The objection was something to the effect that we&#8217;ve been doing cloud computing all along. But the term stuck because it&#8217;s easier to use a single term than to elaborate on the specifics of a nebulous concept each time it comes up in discussion.<\/p>\n<p>When someone mentions the <em>Cloud<\/em>, I immediately understand that they&#8217;re talking about self-service, on-demand provisioning of elastic and virtualized compute and storage resources from a massive online shared pool. If you say public, private, or hybrid cloud, I get a sense of whose infrastructure you&#8217;re referring to. I don&#8217;t think about timesharing on a mainframe, or any of the other things people say we were doing online before we called it the Cloud. I definitely think of <a href=\"http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/about-aws\/whats-new\/2006\/08\/24\/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta\/\">Amazon-type cloud computing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So when someone mentions microservices, I definitely don&#8217;t think of SOA the way we have thought about it for at least the past decade, and I don&#8217;t think of any of the previous generations of component technologies with their proprietary binary communication protocols. In my mental model, I think of self-contained (as in containers) lightweight processes communicating over HTTP, created and deployed with relatively small effort and ceremony, providing narrowly-focused APIs to their consumers.<\/p>\n<p>At some point, a neologism becomes a profession&#8217;s term of art. Microservice might not yet have an established, specific meaning, but as a practical matter when I hear the term I think Node.js and Docker. In my next blog post I&#8217;ll explain why microservice architecture is ideally suited by the convergence of these two technologies and how it benefits your team.<\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"12\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had the opportunity to present on microservices and Node.js\u00a0at NodeSummit\u00a0a few weeks ago.
