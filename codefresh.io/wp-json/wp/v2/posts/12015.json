As with any CI pipeline building an artifact, it\u2019s important to employ the proper security testing tools to ensure a higher level of confidence when deploying. In the case of Docker images, we need a mechanism for scanning and inspecting these artifacts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anchore is a service that conducts static analysis on container images and applies user-defined acceptable policies to allow automated container image validation and certification. This means that not only can Anchore users gain deep insight into the OS and non-OS packages contained within an image, but they have the ability to create governance around the artifact and its contents via customizable policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Example<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, we will walk through how to configure a Codefresh pipeline to build an image from a Dockerfile, conduct an Anchore scan, evaluate the scanned image against an Anchore policy, and push it to a Docker registry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codefresh pipelines are the core component of the Codefresh platform. These pipelines are workflows that contain user-defined steps that are all executed inside user-chosen Docker containers. These steps are defined using a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">codefresh.yaml<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> file.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Anchore scanning step takes place prior to the image being pushed to a Docker registry. Depending on the output of the policy evaluation and pipeline configuration, the image may not be pushed into the registry.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Setup<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to setting up our Codefresh pipeline, an Anchore Engine service needs to be accessible from the pipeline. Typically this is on port 8228. In this example, I have an Anchore Engine service on AWS EC2 with standard configuration. I also have a Dockerfile in a Github repository that I will use to build an image in the first step of the pipeline. In the final step, I will push the built image to an image repository in my personal Dockerhub via Codefresh\u2019s built-in integration to external registries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, we advise using a staging registry and production registry. Meaning, being able to push and pull images freely from the staging\/dev registry while maintaining more control over images being pushed to the production registry. In this example, Codefresh is the staging\/dev registry as every image we build will automatically be stored there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the configuration section of the Codefresh pipeline, I&#8217;ve added the following environment variables:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_FAIL_ON_POLICY<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is set to true, the pipeline will fail, and the image will not be pushed to the registry.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dockerhubUsername<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dockerhubPassword<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_CLI_URL<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_CLI_USER<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_CLI_PASS<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_CLI_IMAGE<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_RETRIES<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ANCHORE_FAIL_ON_POLICY<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also set these values as a shared configuration that can be reused in multiple pipelines by going to Settings -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Shared Configuration.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Build Image<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first step of the pipeline, we build a sample Docker image from a Dockerfile as defined in our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">codefresh.yaml<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">build_image:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0title: Building Docker Image\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0type: build\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0image_name: jvalance\/sampledockerfiles\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0working_directory: .\/\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0dockerfile: Dockerfile<\/pre>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><b>Conduct Anchore Scan<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second step of the pipeline, we scan the image with Anchore as defined in our <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">codefresh.yaml<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<pre class=\"lang:default decode:true\">anchore_scan:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0title: Scanning Docker Image\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0image: anchore\/engine-cli:latest\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0description: Analyzing Image with Anchore...\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0commands:\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- echo \"Adding image to Anchore engine\"\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- anchore-cli image add ${{ANCHORE_SCAN_IMAGE}}\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- echo \"Waiting for image analysis to complete\"\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- counter=0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- while (!
