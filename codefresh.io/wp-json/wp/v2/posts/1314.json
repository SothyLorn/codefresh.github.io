You\u2019ve had a talk with your boss about using Docker in production, but he didn\u2019t feel your excitement. He has asked you to build a business case for it. All you can think about is how much you love Docker, and you don\u2019t get why your boss is so apprehensive. You\u2019re in a spot that many developers find themselves in now that Docker is gaining mainstream adoption. This post gives you some tactics to convince your boss why the team should make the move to Docker for production.<\/p>\n<p><b>1.Check your motives<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we start, a word of caution. You need to ask yourself the real reason why you want to use Docker in production. If it\u2019s just because containers are hot right now, you\u2019re starting with the wrong motive. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your boss is cautious of new technology and suspects Docker could be just another fad. And this is with good reason. He doesn\u2019t want to risk losing money for the business just to stay on the bleeding edge of technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2. Quantify the business value<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Docker makes your life easier as a developer, your boss has bigger priorities, like the application\u2019s stability for end users, and meeting business expectations. So, instead of starting with a generic \u201cLet\u2019s use Docker in production because it eliminates dependency issues,\u201d try to emphasize a more specific benefit for your application. For example, you may be deploying your app on a cloud-based PaaS, and need high fault tolerance. You could quantify this by saying, \u201cIf we Dockerize our app in production, we can reduce downtime by 30%.\u201d Then, your boss is much more likely to be all ears. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key benefit will be different for each app. It could be automation, scalability, fault tolerance, monitoring, or continuous deployment. Whatever the benefit, you need to explain how Docker can solve this issue, and quantify it in terms that make sense to your boss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3. Address the Ops-stacles<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Docker makes it easy for you to package an app and hand it off to Ops to deploy. But for Ops, this could be a nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1315\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption-1024x821.png\" alt=\"survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption\" width=\"1024\" height=\"821\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption-1024x821.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption-300x241.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption-768x616.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption-409x328.png 409w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/survey-biggest-challenges-to-container-adoption.png 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: ClusterHQ.com<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clusterhq.com\/2016\/06\/16\/container-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survey by ClusterHQ<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that the top three challenges to container deployment are persistent storage, networking, and security. These are major concerns for Ops teams who need to orchestrate multiple containers for each app, and monitor their performance. This causes many Ops folks to hate Docker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to work with your Ops team to find solutions to these challenges. Rather than throwing a container over the wall to Ops, involve them in the creation of containers that are compliant. Work together to find the right toolset to orchestrate and monitor containers in production. This is where you need a container lifecycle management platform like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ConvinceYourBosstoUseDocker&amp;utm_source=wordpress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Codefresh<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to simplify the adoption of containers. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your boss is mindful of the Ops side of things, and you should be, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>4. Start small<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A typical rookie mistake is to Dockerize your entire app in one go. This is bound to fail because of all the complexities involved in running an app in production, and the fact that Docker is in a nascent stage. The best way to start is to containerize a few small services, and build up as you go. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could start a pilot running just your app\u2019s notifications service in Docker, for example. Be sure to benchmark existing performance so you have a baseline to compare the performance after Docker. Once your pilot is successful, you\u2019ll find it easier to Dockerize additional services that make up your app. Your boss will find it easier to approve a pilot project than the entire app, and you can avoid costly errors in production. You may not reach complete Dockerization anytime soon, but keep your eye on the goal\u2014to containerize just what you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>5. Use your competitor<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your boss still doesn\u2019t budge, the last resort you could use is to mention a competitor or similar organization that uses Docker in production. If a competitor is using it, they can innovate faster than you. Even if not immediately, your boss will take note of this, and may be more open to making the switch to Docker in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, if all this fails, you need to consider the drawbacks of not using Docker in production right away\u2014and weigh its importance. Sometimes, it\u2019s better to wait it out than risk straining the relationship with your boss. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Docker becomes the norm for deploying apps in production. If your boss doesn\u2019t see the value of Docker now, he will when it becomes widespread in production environments. <\/span><\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1314\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So \u00a0you\u2019ve been using Docker to package your apps in development and testing environments, and now you\u2019re itching to extend this to production as well.
