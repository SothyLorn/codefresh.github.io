Instead of redefining these terms, let me cite the \u201cofficial\u201d definitions from the guys at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ThoughtWorks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who literally wrote the <a href=\"https:\/\/martinfowler.com\/books\/duvall.html\">books <\/a>on these topics:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuous Delivery (CD) is the natural extension of Continuous Integration: an approach in which teams ensure that every change to the system is releasable, and that we can release any version at the push of a button. Continuous Delivery aims to make releases boring, so we can deliver frequently and get fast feedback on what users care about.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>For more information on the subject, you can also read the article <a href=\"https:\/\/thenewstack.io\/understanding-the-difference-between-ci-and-cd\/\">about the differences between CI and CD<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Pipelines: What are they? <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have CI and CD in place, the deployable unit path is called a pipeline. You can see an example pipeline in the image below:<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12652\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12652\" style=\"width: 1871px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines.png\" alt=\"A modern pipeline\" width=\"1871\" height=\"845\" class=\"size-full wp-image-12652\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines.png 1871w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines-300x135.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines-768x347.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines-1024x462.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/visual-pipelines-628x284.png 628w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-12652\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A modern pipeline<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pipeline procedure is triggered when code is committed to a repository hosted somewhere like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GitHub<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Next comes notification to a build system, such as Codefresh. The build system compiles the code and runs unit tests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait, your code does have unit tests, right? Of course it does; I don\u2019t know why I asked. (If you are not doing unit testing, you need to!) Back to the pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your pipeline is built well, and unit tests go smoothly, at this point integration tests should be the next step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After integration testing is done, you can create images and <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/docs\/docs\/docker-registries\/external-docker-registries\/\">push them to a registry service<\/a>, such as Docker Hub. From there, they can be easily deployed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is just a basic example. A pipeline can do many other things, such as performing security scans, run quality checks on the code, send slack notifications etc. You can also have approval steps that stop a pipeline and <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/continuous-deployment\/manual-approval\/\">ask for human approval<\/a> before resuming their operations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some pipelines also include automatic deployment (which is sometimes called Continuous Deployment) to a test environment for user validation after the packages are built.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Pipelines: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know what a pipeline is, let\u2019s discuss the pros and cons of pipelines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Probably the biggest con (although it\u2019s easy to avoid as long as you approach pipelines in a healthy way) is the temptation of trying to build your own tools in-house to handle the core work that is done during the CI\/CD pipeline. This is insane. As I mentioned in the previous section, there are more than enough tools available in the market to get you started without having to reinvent the wheel. A lot of companies try to build a pipeline using bash or python scripts. Almost always they end up with a spaghetti structure of files and methods that nobody wants to edit or add features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pipelines done the wrong way can also be dangerous because they can limit the amount of choice you have in deciding which tools to use. You can spend a lot of time trying to find the perfect tool, or combination of tools, to meet your dream scenario. A better approach is simply to find tools that are good enough to start. Whatever tool you pick first, you will probably be missing a specific feature you want, or it will be too big or small for what you need it to do. This is why you should always tweak, tune, optimize, and substitute components in your pipeline as your product size and needs change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Codefresh is one of the few solutions that covers both CI and CD so it is very easy to get started with pipelines that only work with unit tests and code packaging and move then gradually to more complex workflow that handle deployment.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, for the good parts of pipelines. There is lots and lots of good about pipelines when they are done the right way. Some of the highlights of a well assembled pipeline are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developers can just worry about their code and dependencies, not runtime configuration.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testers can see what tests have been automatically run, and then either automate more, investigate trouble areas, or simply spend their time on the new functionality to validate it against client requirements.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operations can just redeploy if something isn\u2019t working inside an application. No restoring from tape, or wondering what changed and wasn\u2019t documented.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introducing new versions or bug fixes is the same routine process.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Velocity of deployments is increased. New features reach production much faster.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Importance of Pipelines<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The single most important piece of a solid deployment pipeline is that it is so consistent and reliable, it\u2019s boring. Building code isn\u2019t fun, packaging things and managing dependencies between versions sucks, and having someone waiting around to make sure every successful build gets put in the correct test environment right away is a bad use of everyone\u2019s time.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any developer that has been in the industry for a while has fought to get something deployed in a second (or 15th) environment and it just won\u2019t start, or throws a weird error that no one has seen before. Then, the game to find what step got missed, starts. Of course it\u2019s always someone else who missed the step, and asking other people if they performed ALL of the steps in their jobs in order to track down the source of the problem is extremely time-consuming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With delivery pipelines, however, you get the same result every time, so if it works in the system test environment it will work in UAT and staging and production.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boring is good. Just ask your friendly neighborhood first responder. The best days are the boring days when they don\u2019t need to rush anywhere. Those days happen much more often when you have a well-designed and implemented CI\/CD pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your pipeline should be boring and repeatable. It should just work. It should be visible to all project stakeholders (even some non-technical people). Project managers for example should be able to see a pipeline and know if a feature is now in production or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Psst, want to try it out? <a href=\"https:\/\/g.codefresh.io\/signup?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Post&amp;utm_campaign=WhatisconB\">Check out Codefresh<\/a>, it&#8217;s the best\u00a0CI\/CD for Docker out there.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/g.codefresh.io\/signup?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=Post&amp;utm_campaign=BannerB\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5645 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Pasted-image-at-2017_11_23-04_46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Pasted-image-at-2017_11_23-04_46-PM.png 728w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Pasted-image-at-2017_11_23-04_46-PM-300x37.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Pasted-image-at-2017_11_23-04_46-PM-628x78.png 628w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1333\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In \u00a0today\u2019s technology landscape (which one could describe as a sky filled with clouds that overlook a sea of IoT devices), clients expect a constant flow of updates.
