But when it comes to debugging, this technological match-made-in-heaven goes suddenly south.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kubernetes recommends running your microservices, together with debugging tools, within a remote shell on a running container. This approach, however, is costly, cumbersome and entirely foreign to most devs working today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, for developers who prefer local debugging \u2013 which is to say, almost all devs \u2013 the interdependencies of microservice architectures makes microservice-based apps exceptionally difficult to replicate or simulate on a local machine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s a developer to do when s\/he needs to debug?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that many solutions that simulate microservice environments on local machines are already available. However, none is the magic bullet that makes microservice debugging easy to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s review the solutions that are out there and see how they work \u2013 or do not.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Local debugging solutions<\/b><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Automation scripts<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enable devs to run microservices on their own machines. So far, so good, right? But scripts tend to break since configurations must be tightly controlled and branches must remain aligned. As a result, this is a high-maintenance approach that is frustrating for devs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/typicode\/hotel\"><b>Hotel<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is like a local process manager for running microservices. This open-source project enables devs to start and stop services and view all logs in a browser tab. Like automation scripts, however, smooth operation of Hotel depends on controlled configurations and tightly aligned branches. And devs must invest time and effort in learning a new tool.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/compose\/\"><b>Docker Compose<\/b><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker apps. As such, architectural changes must be recorded in the Docker Compose YAML. While configuration is more dev-friendly than for automation scripts, advance Kubernetes configurations can be difficult to replicate. In addition, logs from all microservices are written in one location, making it difficult to match each microservice with the log data it has generated.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/setup\/minikube\/\"><b>Minikube<\/b><\/a><b>, <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an official CNCF tool for spinning up Kubernetes instances on local machines, should, by all rights be the best solution. So it\u2019s disappointing that K8S configurations generally do not work in Minikube without some adjustment. Developers using Minikube also need to know how to change Kubernetes configurations, a skill that is foreign and frightening for many devs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Remote debugging solutions<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the decidedly mixed success of these local debugging approaches, perhaps it\u2019s time to explore options for debugging Kubernetes remotely, daunting as the concept may seem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kubernetes orchestration mechanisms and optimization methodologies are great for microservices development and production, but they make debugging tough since access to pods is highly unstable. Using an SSH command to run debugging tools on a pod is likely to trigger K8S to shut down the tools before you get the data you seek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that warning in mind, let\u2019s have a look at the various methods you can use to debug microservices in Kubernetes.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Adding logs and redeploying<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the classic approach. Unfortunately, it is also expensive and time-consuming \u2013 even if you get enough of the right data to get insight into the issue\u2019s root cause (which is by no means always the case).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Attaching to a process<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is challenging you will have to make sure the process id namespace between the debugger and the application are shared. And then K8S may kill your pod at any moment, causing contact with the debugger to be lost.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Redirecting traffic <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from the cluster to the dev machine can help you recreate issues. However, it is insecure and can easily overtax local computers if a great deal of data is involved. Installation of a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/kubernetes.io\/docs\/concepts\/workloads\/controllers\/daemonset\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DaemonSet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on each node to mount the container runtime socket may be required to see all process on all nodes. And redirecting traffic exposes data to the dangers of the internet<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Service meshes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/istio.io\/docs\/concepts\/what-is-istio\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Istio<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/linkerd.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linkerd<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enable you to track the interactions within a network of microservices, as well as inbound and outbound traffic, without changing code. You can see the entire flow of a request through the microservices stack, thanks to distributed tracing capabilities, so you can pinpoint requests or microservices that might be problematic. However, additional tools are necessary to find the root cause of issues, since service meshes can tell you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there is a problem, but not <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that problem occurs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Adding logs at runtime<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by adding an SDK to your code is the easiest way to deploy to Kubernetes architecture. It allows you to add logs on the fly without writing more code and redeploying, so you can get data from code in real-time.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Live datapoint collection<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some solutions for adding logs at runtime, like Stackdriver, are limited to specific cloud services, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rookout.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rookout<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enables rapid debugging for dev, staging and production environments in any cloud. It supports a wide range of languages, including Node.JS, JVM-based languages and Python-based applications for both PyPy and CPython interpreters (with more to come!).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rookout requires no additional code, restarts or redeployment. Add non-breaking breakpoints, as you would with a regular debugger, to get data instantly. Even as data is pipelined on the fly to your choice of destination, the app continues to operate without interruption.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><strong>Watch the #CodefreshLive webinar including a live demo <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/events\/complete-guide-live-debugging-kubernetes-pods\/\">here.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Live Debugging Kubernetes Pods Webinar\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EMW8VIskzk4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"14278\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editors Note: This is a guest blog post provided by Rookout.
