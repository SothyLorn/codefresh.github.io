Codefresh is launching a number of new features aimed at improving the experience and speed of continuous integration and deployment with GitOps.

Questions that were difficult to answer about monolithic architectures can be down right impossible to answer about large microservice stacks. This is why our first pillar of GitOps 2.0 is observability. Today we\u2019re releasing better tooling to not only deploy software on Kubernetes, but additional observability so you can see not only what code but also what issues are deployed.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18084\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1921\" height=\"1436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability.png 1921w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1024x765.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-768x574.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1536x1148.png 1536w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-20x15.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1921px) 100vw, 1921px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to a detailed view that lets you see everything related to a release and controls over rollbacks, we have larger aggregate views that make it easy to tell what\u2019s going on across all your applications.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18083\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1055\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2.png 2048w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2-300x155.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2-1024x528.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2-768x396.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2-1536x791.png 1536w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-dashboard-2-20x10.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Having this visibility and control can give teams more confidence in their release process and lead to them deploying more often.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, one beta customer said \u201cThese flows work refreshingly well and provide enormous insight into our Kubernetes infrastructure.\u201d This insight is key to deploying more often and with more automation, ultimately making software delivery faster and more reliable.<\/p>\n<p>Another engineer, Victor Cuascut from Veeva said &#8220;Having GitOps directly embedded in Codefresh made things just click for our devs.&#8221; That kind of experience is exactly what we\u2019re going for.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/features\/gitops\/\">codefresh.io\/features\/gitops<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Or checkout the <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/docs\/docs\/ci-cd-guides\/gitops-deployments\/\">documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is an area of active development and we\u2019ll be rolling out more features over the coming weeks and months so stay tuned!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18099\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1795\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1.png 1795w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1-300x60.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1-1024x206.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1-768x154.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1-1536x309.png 1536w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/gitops-observability-1-20x4.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1795px) 100vw, 1795px\" \/> <i>Jira issues, commits, and committers are all brought into the release view.<\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Introducing logic to GitOps Flows<\/h3>\n<p>Another important area we\u2019re supporting is building logic about how rollouts should occur and when. The guiding principle is that your infrastructure should reflect the state of Git. In practice, sometimes you need to be able to handle rollouts between many regions, or you may not yet be at a state where you\u2019re ready to take humans out of the loop to do approvals. For this we\u2019ve introduced different deployment steps for pipelines that can trigger Git synchronization based on pipeline logic.<\/p>\n<p>This allows more advanced flows such as deploy, open PRs onto other infrastructure repos, or rollouts across different clusters and segments as well as automated testing of deployed versions with rollbacks.<\/p>\n<h3>The beginnings of GitOps 2.0<\/h3>\n<p>While this first step is a big win for teams delivering software there are a number of other challenges to solve. GitOps has proven to be a robust pattern for deploying software but there are still questions to answer. While we believe observability is one important one, there are more challenges to overcome. We don\u2019t think we can solve them all ourselves so we\u2019re going to be engaging the community. The goal is to work together to define those patterns that will help mainstream and standardize approaches to delivering software, whether it\u2019s on Kubernetes or not.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of GitOps 2.0 is ultimately to provide patterns and standards that improve software delivery and reliability. GitOps has evolved around a few core principles but has a number of questions that need to be addressed. Dealing with multiple environments, secrets, and of course observability are all key aspects that we hope to address.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 11\/19 &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>We have officially partnered with other industry leaders to start the GitOps working group under the auspices of the CNCF! <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/devops\/announcing-gitops-working-group\/\">Read all about it here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Try out GitOps with Codefresh<\/h3>\n<p>As always, these features are all free to try when you create an account at <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\">codefresh.io<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Or <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/gitops-guide\/\">download the ebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"17992\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today marks our first step towards the future.
