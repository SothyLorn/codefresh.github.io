The feeling of knowing the work you\u2019re doing is on the cutting edge? That you\u2019re creating solutions for people just like you, because you know what they need to make their jobs easier, and you know how to provide it? No? Well, I do, and my team does too. And we think everyone deserves to feel that way.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get personal here. I started my career 25 years ago, as a QA engineer. Since then I\u2019ve worked within various positions; as a software engineer, lead engineer, architect, senior architect; I started my career in a start-up and played a part in helping to grow it into a large multinational corporation. For many years, I held both technical and management roles. Why am I telling you all this? Because I want you to know that I have both been an engineer and I\u2019ve led engineers through big and innovative projects. So, I know what it\u2019s like from both points of view.<\/p>\n<p>Before I joined Codefresh, I was leading an R&amp;D team of over 100 engineers in a large enterprise company. There were loads of great benefits of working there. But I\u2019ve always been excited by a new, fresh challenge. So, I started to look for a modern, dynamic environment, where I could make a difference, in a place where people are enthusiastic and motivated by their work.<\/p>\n<p>For me and so many of my colleagues, the attraction of Codefresh is that we are developers creating solutions for other developers. Our job is to make CI\/CD processes easier, more secure, and more robust for our customers, and we can do this because we know the challenges they face \u2013 and the struggle is real! There\u2019s a sense of familiarity \u2013 we \u2018know\u2019 our customers, the way they think, what they expect, what they wish they were able to do if only they had the right tools. We understand their creativity, and we value their work. Since it is so easy to put ourselves in their shoes, we are driven to create the solutions they need. Because who wouldn\u2019t want to make life easier for their peers if they could?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re committed to building the best CI\/CD platform out there. In a dynamic and competitive environment, we\u2019re dealing with cutting-edge technologies in the fields of engineering architecture, microservices, Kubernetes, and more. Our customers are varied, ranging from large financial enterprises to cutting-edge gaming industries &#8211; but what they all have in common is that they demand the best. Staying one, or even two, steps ahead of the pack, we anticipate trends, analyze exciting new technologies, and then deliver top-of-the-line solutions that give our fellow developers the tools they need to achieve their own goals. Now, that\u2019s something to get you out of bed every day!<\/p>\n<p>By the way, if you like what you\u2019re hearing \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/careers\/\">we\u2019re hiring<\/a>. If you think you\u2019ve got what it takes \u2013 whether you\u2019re experienced but hungry for a new challenge, or a newbie looking for a place to grow &#8211; give us a call.<\/p>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"18729\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know that feeling where you wake up and you\u2019re excited to go to work?
