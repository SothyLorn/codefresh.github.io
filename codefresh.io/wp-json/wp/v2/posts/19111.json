Additionally, Snyk provides comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/support.snyk.io\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360003812458-Getting-started-with-the-CLI\">documentation <\/a>for all their tooling.<\/p>\n<h2>Aqua<\/h2>\n<h5>Overview<\/h5>\n<p>While Snyk has a high focus on providing security scanning throughout the entire development lifecycle, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aquasec.com\/\">Aqua\u2019s <\/a>offering focuses specifically on infrastructure security scanning by integrating with popular cloud providers. This section will take a detailed look at Aqua.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, Aqua just raised a total of $265 million as of the time of writing.<\/p>\n<h5>Available Products<\/h5>\n<p>Aqua\u2019s Vulnerability Scanning includes the following<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aquasec.com\/container-vulnerability-management\">Vulnerability Intelligence Feed<\/a>: A dashboard on discovered vulnerabilities from across your codebase and analytics insights on the security of your application<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aquasec.com\/integrations\/#ci-cd\">Rich CI\/CD integration<\/a>: Allows users to scan the code based during development<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aquasec.com\/rule-based-registry-scanning\">Scanning Registries and Stored Functions<\/a>: Discover dependency vulnerabilities early, before deploying containers<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/info.aquasec.com\/cloud-native-vulnerability-management\">Vulnerability Management Workflow<\/a>: Provides strategies for managing vulnerabilities and integrating vulnerability discovery into your workflow<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aquasec.com\/container-vulnerability-scanning-layers\">I<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.aquasec.com\/container-vulnerability-scanning-layers\">dentifying Vulnerabilities by Image Layer<\/a>: Check for vulnerabilities in image components before using those across your container images<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is provided through the following products<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security products for several Cloud Providers: Aqua offers solutions to monitor and secure cloud-native workloads on AWS, Google Cloud, Red Hat, and Azure<\/li>\n<li>Kubernetes Security is focused on workloads and security of your Kubernetes infrastructure to identify risks within your cluster early<\/li>\n<li>Docker Security for both the Docker Enterprise and the Docker Community edition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Overall, Aqua provides with each of its product offerings several sub-categories that you can utilize. For instance, as part of the Docker Security offering, you can make use of their secret management.<\/p>\n<h5>Pricing<\/h5>\n<p>Aqua provides a similar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aquasec.com\/pricing\/\">pricing model<\/a> to Snyk. The free account is for developers, who want to keep track of the security of their infrastructure. Specifically, you can connect to one account, and receive monthly Scan and Compliance reports. Unlike with Snyk, the container security features are only part of the paid plans. The first plan starts at $849 for up to 25 developers. From there, the pricing will scale with the number of developers using the platform. The custom plan provides additional features such as Event Monitoring and Remediation.<\/p>\n<h5>Integration\/Automation<\/h5>\n<p>The Dashboard provides an overview of the current vulnerabilities found across the connected infrastructure as well as the container registry. It is extremely modular and allows users to adapt the graphics depending on the data they want to highlight through simply dragging and dropping different components.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19115\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19115\" style=\"width: 1847px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19115\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3.png\" alt=\"aqua-dashboard\" width=\"1847\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3.png 1847w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3-1024x389.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3-768x292.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3-1536x584.png 1536w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image2-3-20x8.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1847px) 100vw, 1847px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19115\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aqua Dashboard<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Codefresh offers custom integration with Aqua through a custom step that you can use within any Codefresh pipeline.

Running the custom step will automatically check your container image for vulnerabilities with every deployment.<\/p>\n<h5>Documentation<\/h5>\n<p>Once you access your Aqua account, you will be able to view all features but depending on your plan, you will not be able to access everything. If you are on the free tier, all unavailable products will be locked. This allows users to get an idea of the tools that would be available without having to spend much effort going through the offering on the website. However, it might overwhelm users, who only want to make use of a subset of the available features. The screenshot below provides an example of Aqua hiding specific features that require a paid tier.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19116\" style=\"width: 1556px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19116\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1.png\" alt=\"hidden-dashboard\" width=\"1556\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1.png 1556w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1-300x137.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1-1024x469.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1-768x352.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1-1536x704.png 1536w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image6-1-20x9.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1556px) 100vw, 1556px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hidden Features in the dashboard<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>You can find explanations on each feature on their website, however, there is no direct link to user guides in documentation style format, which would come in handy for smaller teams and free accounts, which do not have access to a personal customer support agent. The only guide that we were able to locate is the enterprise guide, available for paid accounts.<\/p>\n<h5>CLI vs. UI support<\/h5>\n<p>Aqua focuses on the infrastructure and tools used to run your cloud-native deployments. As such you can integrate Aqua with your existing tools and platforms, initiate scans and view reports through the UI. However, Aqua does not provide a separate CLI that you can access locally through your terminal. As a result, the interface has to be used for all interactions between your infrastructure and Aqua.<\/p>\n<h2>Sysdig<\/h2>\n<h5>Overview<\/h5>\n<p>Sysdig provides a range of products to enhance the security of your container and cloud-native solutions. The main differentiator of Sysdig is that it is built on several cloud-native, open-source tools, namely<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/falco.org\/\">Falco<\/a>: Cloud-native runtime security project<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/prometheus.io\/\">Prometheus<\/a>: Open source cluster monitoring tool<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While Prometheus is a graduating project of the CNCF foundation, Falco is currently a CNCF incubating project.<\/p>\n<h5>Available Products<\/h5>\n<p>Sysdig is mainly focused on image scanning and monitoring of your containers and Kubernetes cluster. With this in mind, it provides solutions around the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Image Scanning<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Continuous Compliance<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Runtime Security<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Prometheus Monitoring<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Incident Response &amp; Troubleshooting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Pricing<\/h5>\n<p>Sysdig provides comprehensive details around its pricing options. Their <a href=\"https:\/\/sysdig.com\/pricing\/\">pricing page<\/a> shows a comprehensive comparison of the features provided by each tier. However, they do not provide a free option. Additionally, users will be charged per tool separately, as well as by the number of accounts needed. The \u2018Monitoring Essentials\u2019 start at $20, \u2018Secure Essentials\u2019 at $40, and the \u2018Platform Essentials\u2019 at $50 per month and per user. Below is a brief overview of the features that each part of the platform offers. Please refer to their <a href=\"https:\/\/sysdig.com\/pricing\/\">pricing page<\/a> for further information.<\/p>\n<p><b>Platform Essentials<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Platform Essentials provide a comprehensive list of features from across their offerings. This includes comprehensive Dashboards, image scanning, resource monitoring, compliance tracking, and more.<\/p>\n<p><b>Secure Essentials<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Secure Essentials focus on resource scanning and reporting with fewer features than the Platform Essentials.<\/p>\n<p><b>Monitor Essentials\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Monitor Essentials helps to monitor your resources and visualize their performance in dashboards.<\/p>\n<p>Note that this pricing is billed annually and costs more if paid monthly.<\/p>\n<h5>Integration<\/h5>\n<p>Once you sign-up to the platform, you will be provided with a set of onboarding steps. For Sysdig to be able to monitor your cluster, you have to install a Helm chart to access the required Kubernetes resources.<\/p>\n<p>The Sysdig UI has two main sections, one for monitoring and one for security that each has a separate onboarding guide. Furthermore, the UI allows users to either utilize Dashboard templates or create their dashboard view:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19117\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19117\" style=\"width: 1839px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19117\" src=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2.png\" alt=\"Sysdig-Dashboard\" width=\"1839\" height=\"813\" srcset=\"https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2.png 1839w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2-300x133.png 300w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2-1024x453.png 1024w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2-768x340.png 768w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2-1536x679.png 1536w, https:\/\/codefresh.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image5-2-20x9.png 20w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1839px) 100vw, 1839px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19117\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sysdig Dashboard<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Some additional options include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Comprehensive Dashboard showing your cluster resources and the health of those;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Workloads of the resources deployed on your cluster;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Compliance monitoring;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity audits;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">And more!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>Automation<\/h5>\n<p>Sysdig provides a selective list of additional integrations per each product segment. Depending on the tools that you are using, you can add additional integrations to extend the functionality of the platform. For instance, as part of their <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.sysdig.com\/en\/integrations-for-sysdig-monitor.html#UUID-38260ebb-a73a-efe8-250a-d8b0a28efa87_UUID-c0395aa5-74f4-8b07-c1ef-c9040837a366\">monitoring solution,<\/a> you can integrate with Prometheus to collect additional metrics for your application.<\/p>\n<h5>Documentation<\/h5>\n<p>Sysdig has by far the most comprehensive documentation. It takes a while to navigate since it is divided by product, instead of tools or goal-based. However, once you find the pages of the documentation that correspond to the UI and your use case, it is much easier to use Sysdig to its fullest potential. Sysdig has put a lot of effort into detailing the use of the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, it is worth noting that some integrations might be possible but are not explicitly detailed on their documentation.<\/p>\n<h5>CLI vs. UI support<\/h5>\n<p>Both the interactions with the CLI as well as the UI have been extremely intuitive and straightforward. While Sysdig requires a few more hoops to install the necessary resources on your cluster, the documentation and UI provide easy onboarding to get everything set up.<\/p>\n<h2>Comparison<\/h2>\n<p>Both Snyk and Aqua target a similar group of users but for different use cases. Snyk is focused on security scanning during the application development, as well as the scanning of cloud native resources such as your container registry. In comparison, Aqua provides specific products for Cloud security, such as an offering around Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.<\/p>\n<p>Sysdig provides a similar offering but rather than accessing metrics through custom integrations, it utilizes a set of open source tools to display metrics. While it provides detailed insights into your existing resources and comprehensive monitoring of those, it does not provide the same level of container vulnerability scanning as Snyk.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, Snyk and Aqua provide more custom offerings for enterprise clients while Sysdig allows users to combine the different tools available based on their needs. With this in mind, Sysdig is highly flexible in the ways that the platform can be utilized.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a small business with budget constraints or an open-source project, you might want to have a look at the free offering by Snyk or evaluate the pricing by Sysdig. If its features fulfil your requirements, go with Snyk. In comparison, if you are looking for more advanced tooling and support, take a look at ways that Sysdig can be tailored to your needs. In comparison, Aqua does not provide a similar number of features within the free tier.<\/p>\n<p>Deciding between Aqua and Snyk becomes more relevant to large-scale enterprises that require comprehensive tooling and support for those. Additionally, you should take into account the level of support that your team might require to integrate with either platform. In this case, the amount and quality of the documentation become an important factor.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, all three tools are SaaS-first platforms. However, if you prefer to run the platform on your infrastructure, Sysdig offers an on-prem version while <a href=\"https:\/\/support.snyk.io\/hc\/en-us\/sections\/360000936017-Broker-and-on-prem\">Snyk provides OnPrem services<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\"><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Feature<\/td>\n<td>Snyk<\/td>\n<td>Aqua<\/td>\n<td>Sysdig<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Free for open source<\/td>\n<td>Yes (limited features)<\/td>\n<td>Yes (limited features)<\/td>\n<td>No, but utilizes<br \/>\nopen-source tooling<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pricing method<\/td>\n<td>Monthly, per user<\/td>\n<td>Monthly, per user<\/td>\n<td>Monthly, per user<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pricing starts at<\/td>\n<td>$417<\/td>\n<td>$849<\/td>\n<td>$20<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scans libraries<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scans containers<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Scans infrastructure<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Special support for<br \/>\nKubernetes and containers<br \/>\nand cloud<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comprehensive API<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comprehensive CLI<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Easy integrations with<br \/>\nother tools<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Easy integration with CI\/CD<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comprehensive documentation<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<td>No<\/td>\n<td>Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unique feature<\/td>\n<td>PR with vulnerability<br \/>\nfixes &amp; CLI tool<\/td>\n<td>VM and Serverless<br \/>\nSecurity<\/td>\n<td>Design your<br \/>\nDashboard<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Great for whom?<\/td>\n<td>Open source and enterprises<\/td>\n<td>Large enterprises<\/td>\n<td>Smaller companies<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table><\/div>\n<h2>Summary<\/h2>\n<p>This article provided a comprehensive overview of three of the major security scanning tools available within the cloud-native ecosystem.
