It was such a crazy dichotomy that I just couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at the absurd difference between the two.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I still have to request VMs by filling out a Word document. But, once I get them, I just slap the Docker Engine in and make great things happen.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Two stories really stood out from the rest. One engineer with the username <em>arcticblue<\/em>\u00a0shared how their\u00a0adoption of Docker led them\u00a0to move halfway across the world and\u00a0their\u00a0skills were lucrative enough to pay for their\u00a0mother-in-laws&#8217;s expensive medical care.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Docker helped me move halfway around the world on a whim, find a job, and help keep my mother-in-law alive.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the end we needed to pick a winner and user <em>ghostcopy<\/em>\u00a0came through with a great fiction story about being swallowed by the great Docker whale.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I realized what was happening. The dream, the inefficient monoliths I was building, the suffering I was putting my team through as they waited for VMs to be given to them by infra\/ops. The warning signs were pointing to this.

I knew I was wrong for doing this, but it was the only way I knew how to do things. There was no time for anything else. If a component crashed and brought down the rest of the service, then to hell with it. It\u2019s what the boss wanted.<\/p>\n<p>Sam called out from across the darkeness. \u201cJonah, are you there?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Sam, I\u2019m here. Where are we?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jonah. All I remember is working with you in the office and then getting blindsided.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I remembered I had a lighter in my pocket. It\u2019s funny because I never smoked, but I always carried a lighter because of the belief it\u2019s just a useful item to carry around. Sam always gave me shit for that, but I\u2019m sure at this moment he\u2019d be grateful. I pulled out the lighter and sparked it up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThank God, Jonah. I never actually thought your fucking lighter would come to use.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I chuckled at Sam\u2019s comment while trying to explore my surroundings. As I slowly moved forward, I felt around with my hands. I couldn\u2019t see more than a foot ahead of me.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDude what the fuck is this? It\u2019s slimy,\u201d Sam remarked<\/p>\n<p>I reached out to feel the wall. It was soft and moist. It almost felt like a mucous-lined membrane. I had been here before. It was in a dream four nights ago. Then I suddenly froze.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSam, that ELK stack you were working. Were you deploying the components as VMs or containers?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey were VMs. The boss doesn\u2019t believe in containers, Jonah. And it\u2019s not like we ever took the time to justify containers to him. Why the fuck does it matter right now?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I realized what was happening. The dream, the inefficient monoliths I was building, the suffering I was putting my team through as they waited for VMs to be given to them by infra\/ops. The warning signs were pointing to this. We had been swallowed by Moby Dock.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSam, you\u2019re not going to believe this, but I need to tell you something.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSam?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sam was gone.<\/p>\n<p>I sat there alone, in silence. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to make it out. I thought about everything I had learned about docker. Not only were containers super convenient and fast, but swarm mode allowed me to join multiple hosts as a cluster and scale out my services. But I insisted on the old ways. I had seen the error of my ways, but it was too late. Just as I was giving up hope, a voice called out.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJonah, you are one my best DevOps engineers, but you strayed from the path of DevOps.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I knew who it was.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I now see the error of my ways. Forgive me\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is never too late to change, Jonah. Now go.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>My surroundings started to violently shake. Water started to fill up the space, and I was submerged. I couldn\u2019t see. I couldn\u2019t breathe. Then, as I made my final gasp for air, I was forcefully expelled from within Moby Dock onto dry land. I got up and dried myself off. It didn\u2019t take long to realize where I was. I was in Austin. Moby Dock had shown me where I need to be in April.<\/p>\n<p>Later that day I caught a flight back to my home city. I stepped into my office and Sam approached me.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInfra says they need another 2 weeks to get us those VMs, Jonah\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTell infra that won\u2019t be necessary, Sam.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t we need the VMs?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to containerize, Sam.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sam and I have never looked back since.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<input class=\"fooboxshare_post_id\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1929\"\/>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In preparation for\u00a0Dockercon this year we noticed that we had an extra badge and wondered what we should do with it.\u00a0We decided we should ask the community to tell their best Docker stories and we&#8217;d pick a winner for the pass.
